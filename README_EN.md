## 🔏 License

**Orbit.io** is open-source software licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3)**.  
This license promotes user freedom and collaboration in open-source software development.

### **Rights and Permissions**

- **Internal Use**:  
  You can freely use Orbit.io within your infrastructure, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, without the obligation to share the code, **as long as the software is not made publicly available**.

- **Modification and Customization**:  
  You can modify Orbit.io and implement new features.
  - If you distribute the modified software or use it in a remotely accessible service (such as SaaS), you must publicly share the code of your changes under the same terms as AGPLv3.

### **Requirements for Distribution or Commercial Use**

If Orbit.io is used as part of a public or commercial service or product, you must:

1. **Make the Source Code Available**  
   All modifications must be publicly shared under the same terms as AGPLv3.

   - **AGPLv3 Reference**: "You must offer access to the corresponding source code, under the same terms of this license, to users of your application." (Section 13).

2. **Acknowledge the Official Project**

   - Clearly mention the official **Orbit.io** project in your interface, communications, and materials.
   - Inform users that they are using a modified version of the software.

3. **Share the Modified Code**
   - Publish a link to the repository containing your modifications, allowing others to review the code.
   - **AGPLv3 Reference**: "Modifications must be clearly identified for users, indicating the original version and the modified one." (Section 5).

### **Why Did We Choose AGPLv3?**

The AGPLv3 license ensures that **Orbit.io** and all its improvements remain accessible to the open-source community. It also ensures that commercial use respects principles of transparency, collaboration, and equal benefits for all improvements made. Additionally, it prevents companies from using the software in commercial environments without contributing back to the community.
